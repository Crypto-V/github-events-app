# GitHub Events API Analyzer

The objective of this assignment is to get a sense of your design and
coding approach to a problem, what you pay attention to â€“ basically your
thought process to software development. Remember to comment your
code thoroughly, explaining your rationale for any important decisions and
the functionality of each section of the code. Feel free to use any
programming language of your choice to complete this task. You may use
any external libraries or packages that you find necessary.
